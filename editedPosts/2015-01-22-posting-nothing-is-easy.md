Starting a site is actually quite easy.

1. Find a [generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-jekyllized).
2. Install everything to run the generator.
3. Fix a few [bugs](https://github.com/rowoot/gulp-gh-pages/issues/13)?
4. And then serve.

_Voila!_

Maintaining a website?
	
1.Well.

2.Well...

3.**Well......**

Its even harder when you really don’t know what to blog about.

I like experimenting, and this site is essentially going to be my play ground. A lot of thought even went into choosing this platform and framework. Hopefully it shall pay off.

In the meantime, to compensate for the incapability of blogging, I shall just give a running commentary on how this website morphs. Maybe if I figure how to change website states so that the current state reflects the post? Let’s see.
