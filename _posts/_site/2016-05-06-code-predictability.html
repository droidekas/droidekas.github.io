<p>When I write code,I like to go through tiny iterations.Each class that I end
up writing gets rewritten approximately twice or thrice during the first initial
writing phase in itself.I realise this could be odd for few people but to me its
natural.</p>

<p>Code is elegant,you want to convey the message as easily as possible.But you
should also keep in mind the black box nature of functions/code snippets.
The most atomic place where you can excercise SRP is at the functions.This
removes the ‘magic’ from code(atleast for the developer it does).If I see
myself copying a segment of code to add it somewhere else I end up making
it a function.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>It might be used in only 2 places,but what I’ve learned
from working in a fast paced release focused environment is changes are
expected to made quickly and with maximum predictability.</p>

<p>Contradictory to this,I choose to specify as less arguments as  possible.
Try to derive arguments from parameters that already exist
Ex.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">iNeedViewAndContext</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">View</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">Context</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">){</span>
  <span class="c1">//Do stuff</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>can be written as</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">iNeedViewAndContext</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">View</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">){</span>
    <span class="n">Context</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getContext</span><span class="o">();</span>
    <span class="c1">//Do stuff</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Infact a much better way would be.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">iNeedViewAndContext</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">View</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">Context</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">){</span>
  <span class="c1">//Do stuff</span>
<span class="o">}</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="nf">iNeedOnlyView</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">View</span> <span class="n">v</span><span class="o">){</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">iNeedViewAndContext</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getContext</span><span class="o">)</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>While these seem quite trivial changes.They can have a cascading effect.
Another important change I made to my code-writing techniques , you need to stop
worrying about names.The amount of type spent in naming
variables/functions/classes is really not justified.This increases exponentially
while making Constants/libraries. Nevertheless well named parameters can often
replace a lot of documentation. So instead of figuring out the shortest smart
name for things,figure out the name which describes its functionality. I really
dont think there is anything wrong in naming a function.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">convertScreenCartesianCoordinatesToImageBoundaryCoordinates</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="o">,</span><span class="kt">float</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="o">)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You end up thanking the past you when you get back to this code after a few
months. It makes debugging a whole lot easier.</p>

<p>Code abstraction is hard,but the benifits outweigh any form of time spent on it.</p>

      <p>IDEs also give you that right click on code and refactor into a function to make it easier for those lazy folks <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote">&#8617;</a></p>
