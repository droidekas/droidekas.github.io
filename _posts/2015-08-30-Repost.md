This would be my second attempt on a blog. The first went well. I managed to set up Travis and gulp and whole thing-ma- jig with it. But then that’s it. It took me eons to write my first post and then the next. Something I realized; in order to make something a habit, you have to make sure that it’s as easily executable as possible. So this is my second attempt. Hopefully a more regular one. I chose to take a different approach here. Normally all the blogs I read involve tutorials. As such my first blog post [^1] . I decided to blog with tutorials about making the website. While that was fun while it lasted. I lost interest soon. I learnt that I loved talking about code and sometimes ranting about it. This blog is to let out those conversations which no normal human would share my enthusiasm for. I like combing through Source code, discussing the beauty of functions and APIs and overall code geekiness. Expect all of that here.

[^1]:Apparently the way back machine does not have my first blogposts and website archived.
