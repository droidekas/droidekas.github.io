I like to dream and most of the time(well considering that's all I read), It is about a dystopic future which ,jokes apart, isnt that far away. 

Assuming your data is all in the cloud.Because that is where the world is headed right now.All data kept on the cloud with thin clients to handle simple operations.That way,an ignorant customer gets the best experience ,while being charged minimal(read free) amounts.While all these free services seem brilliant and provide us immediate accesibility anywhere in any part of the world.What happens when people realize that all the information you own and have collected,belongs not to you or to a  collective us,but to a third party.Who actually have (in the past) several times removed/deleted/_vanished_ such information. Any news are basically the first page of results that come up on Google.So what happens when instead of merely deleting/removing/vanishing they were to manipulate it. Misinformation is a much stronger manipulating agent. You ask what do big entities gain by trying to this. I counter-question with what do you know about the big picture.This is infact not only restricted to corporations. Information does not merely include the thirst for knowledge.Snail mail was affected by spam before our generation,this was followed by e-mail and now is followed by whatsapp forwards. We have these quick-facts forwards that tell us wonderous things and provide inspiration to us.These are never backed up by sources(why should they be?) and are worse than a Times Of India article. 

There was a similar situation where a forward was circulated in Bangalore a long time back. This lead to most of the North-East folks in Bangalore to rush to all modes of transport to hitch rides back to their home towns.There was absolutely no truth in those circulated information.Such turmoil created just because of a message.

These are randomly triggerred points which resulted in chaos, the Butterfly effect can be observed easily when you consider the WWW. So what happens when an organization/person is able to calculate and trigger such points.And make the fire grow? This can be used positively too, but it takes only one bad apple to spoil the lot.

Vigilance has become a necessity now.For both the users and the service providers. Take everything you come across with a grain of salt.Because nowdays,just reading things of the internet really isnt the best way to be smart anymore.
