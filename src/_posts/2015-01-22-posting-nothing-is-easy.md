Starting a site is actually quite easy.

1. Find a [generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-jekyllized).
2. Install everything to run the generator.
3. Fix a few [bugs](https://github.com/rowoot/gulp-gh-pages/issues/13)?
4. And then serve.

_Voila!_

Maintainting a website?
	
1.Well.

2.Well...

3.**Well......**

Its even harder when you really dont know what to blog about.

I like experimenting.And this site is essentially going to be my play ground.A lot of though even went into choosing this platform and framework.Hopefully it shall pay off.

In the mean time,to compensate for the incapability of blogging.I shall just give a running commentary on how this website morphs.Maybe if i figure how to change website states so that the current state reflects the post?Lets see.
