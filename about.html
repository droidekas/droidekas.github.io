## About

I have an innate fascination for software due to which I inherently like to code.I live,eat and breathe code and I am a geek of the highest order.Programming and software is the only avenue which serves my purpose of always having something new to learn and master.I like solving problems and I believe in iterations (the last iteration being solely for aesthetic appeal in code,because code is beautiful).I am a voracious reader and like listening to instrumental music
